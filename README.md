# Portfolio Project
This project was build in order to create a personal portfolio. It is responsive and has all the information about my work. It's simple and it's
not the real portfolio I will use.
# Steps 
A virtual environment was created to make it possible to use Django and Pillow. After installing the Django and other applications, I made the project
itself and the application. Later I put the app into the installed apps, that were part of the settings in the project. I didn't do the following 
after what I just wrote but because I'm explaining the settings part, I want to talk about the other configurations I made there, I added the MEDIA_ROOT and the MEDIA_URL for the directory of media I created after that. And then I created a model with the class of project, later I went to admin and registered the project class. Following that I went to the part of the project that was called urls.py and put in the urlpatterns the path for the main page, and loaded the index from views. Later in views I rendered the index.html. After that I created the folder templates where I put the index.html. Later I made the static directory where the images and CSS where located. After that I made the adjustments in the CSS and HTML. Finally I deployed the application.
# What was delivered
